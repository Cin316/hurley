<h3>What is this nonsense?</h3>

<p>
    This started as a joke in <a href="http://www.relay.fm/cortex/15">episode #15 of <em>Cortex</em></a>, a podcast on the Relay.FM network.
</p>

<p>
    The hosts were joking about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon">Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon</a>, and how Myke is the Kevin Bacon of the podcasting world.
    He founded his own podcast network, and co-hosts many of the shows.
    They were wondering how many connections you could find from Myke to other popular podcasters.

<p>
    Then I made this site.
